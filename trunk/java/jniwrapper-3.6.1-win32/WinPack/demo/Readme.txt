WinPackDemo is an application, which  demonstrates commonly used features of the
WinPack library. In order to run WinPackDemo you should have the following files
that are not distributed with WinPack:

1. Required files (distributed with JNIWrapper):

   - JNIWrapper  license  file  (jniwrap.lic) should  be  located   in  the  bin 
     subfolder of the JNIWrapper distribution.
     
2. Optional files (distributed with ComfyJ) :

   - ComfyJ library  (comfyj-2.4.jar)  should be  located  in  the  WinPack/demo 
     subfolder;
   - ComfyJ  license file  (comfyj.lic)  should be located  in the bin subfolder 
     of the JNIWrapper distribution.
   
NOTE: If you haveComfyJ library of different version, we don't  guarantee proper 
      work of all WinPackDemo samples. In this  case you should either  make the 
      appropriate changes in the WinPackDemo.bat file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
Most of WinPackDemo samples require only  JNIWrapper and  WinPack libraries. But 
there are several samples, which additionaly require ComfyJ library. They are:

  - Dialogs/ChooseFolder;
  - Shell/Shell Links;
  - Shell/Folder Customization;
  - Shell/Active Desktop (partially).
